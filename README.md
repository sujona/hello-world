# hello-world
This is my first test directory where i will put my first test things

I am and have been stuff in the past and the present and will keep on being until some day in the future when all that stops. Onece i wasn't, now i am and one day i won't. This unpersonal presentation became existential musch faster than the present me had ever antisipated in the immediate past. Thanks and good bye. 

now i can do stuf here. 

and now lets tryt his again. Thats surely a good idea.
